## Friday 2nd July
For evidence of how I implemented TDD in my pair group I asked my pair to give feedback on it. Here is their feedback:

'You paid close attention to the user stories, and you stuck to feature test then unit tests (red, green, refactor) well. I thought you were particularly good on the refactor bit, as you can evidence by keeping the release_bike method having a single responsibility.'

the release_bike method that they are referring to can be found in the [boris_bikes repo](https://github.com/YoFirmy/Boris_bikes/blob/main/lib/docking_station.rb).
