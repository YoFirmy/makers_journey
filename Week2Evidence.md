## Monday 5th July
While making a start on the weekly challenge [Oystercard](https://github.com/YoFirmy/Oystercard) I made the following Domain model:

| Object      | Message  |
|-------------|----------|
| Customer    |          |
| Oystercard  | Balance  |
|             | Top up   |

For evidence of how I implemented TDD in my pair group I asked my pair to give feedback on it. Here is their feedback:

'You clearly approached steps with a feature test > unit test > code cycle. I was especially impressed when you realised that some of our code slightly differed from spec - and rather than tweaking the code to more closely match the user story & retrospectively fixing tests, you instead deleted the test and code - before employing the TDD cycle to create the outstanding feature.

In terms of improvement, I think the only thing you could focus on a little more was refactoring. I appreciate you wanted to do a chunk of refactoring after several steps, so perhaps using the refactoring step to mark out which areas you think could be refactored using comments might have been a suitable task for you. Overall, I was deeply impressed with your adherence to a strict TDD approach.'
