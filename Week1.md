# Week 1 

## Weekly Goals
### Goals set by Makers
* Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods
* Pair using the driver-navigator style
* Follow an effective debugging process
* Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP

### Goals set by myself
* Learn Rspec to the point that I am more confident to TDD without being guided.
* Use github in pairing sessions in order to familiarise myself more with common commands.
* Set a routine, try to eat well and get exercise in the morning before check-in, and meditate daily.

## Weekly Plan
* At the end of every day write out the goals for the next day.
* Attend every workshop and meditation session.
* Return to resources listed on [week outlines](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/main/week_outlines.md) when I am stuck for what to do.

## Daily Goals
### Monday 28th June
* Goal(s):
Make a start on the course and set out a plan for the next 12 weeks.
* Plan:
Meet my cohort and tutors, listen to advice from tutors, and start writing my portfolio (Part of what you're reading now!)
* Evidence + reflection:
My evidence is this document! The simple goal to make a start on the course was only in my head from the start, but from now on I will make sure to set goals and plan to reach these goals at the beginning of every week and day so I have something to refer to.

### Tuesday 29th June
* Goal(s):
Become familiar with the debugging process. Use github in pair programming.
* Plan:
Attend debugging workshop and put process into practice. Attend pair programming session.
* Evidence + reflection:
My evidence is the debugging workshop that I managed to complete. Going through the process as shown in the workshop and then completing the other exercises in my own time. In relection I already understand the process (tighten the loop, get visibility, try to fix), but putting it into practice is what will help it stick. 

### Wednesday 30th June
* Goal:
Become more familiar with the TDD process and useful rspec methods
* Plan:
Spend first part of solo learning going through the resources on rspec found in the boris bike challenges. Practice TDD in pair programming session and use TDD process while trying out rspec methods.
* Evidence:
