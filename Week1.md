# Week 1 

## Weekly Goals
### Goals set by Makers
* Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods
* Pair using the driver-navigator style
* Follow an effective debugging process
* Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP

### Goals set by myself
* Learn Rspec to the point that I am more confident to TDD without being guided.
* Use github in pairing sessions in order to familiarise myself more with common commands.
* Set a routine, try to eat well and get exercise in the morning before check-in, and meditate daily.

## Weekly Plan
* At the end of every day write out the goals for the next day.
* Attend every workshop and meditation session.
* Return to resources listed on [week outlines](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/main/week_outlines.md) when I am stuck for what to do.

## Daily Goals
### Monday 28th June
* Goal(s):
Make a start on the course and set out a plan for the next 12 weeks.
* Plan:
Meet my cohort and tutors, listen to advice from tutors, and start writing my portfolio (Part of what you're reading now!)
* Evidence + reflection:
My evidence is this document! The simple goal to make a start on the course was only in my head from the start, but from now on I will make sure to set goals and plan to reach these goals at the beginning of every week and day so I have something to refer to.

### Tuesday 29th June
* Goal(s):
Become familiar with the debugging process. Use github in pair programming.
* Plan:
Attend debugging workshop and put process into practice. Attend pair programming session.
* Evidence + reflection:
My evidence is the debugging workshop that I managed to complete. Going through the process as shown in the workshop and then completing the other exercises in my own time. In relection I already understand the process (tighten the loop, get visibility, try to fix), but putting it into practice is what will help it stick. 

### Wednesday 30th June
* Goal(s):
Become more familiar with the TDD process and useful rspec matchers.
* Plan:
Spend first part of solo learning going through the resources on rspec found in the boris bike challenges. (specifically [rspec's basics](https://semaphoreci.com/community/tutorials/getting-started-with-rspec), [rspec's new syntax](https://rspec.info/blog/2012/06/rspecs-new-expectation-syntax/), [one-liner syntax](https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-core/v/3-2/docs/subject/one-liner-syntax)) Practice TDD in pair programming session and use TDD process while trying out rspec methods.
* Evidence:
The commit history of my [repo](https://github.com/JEC1100/boris_bikes_2) will show that Iâ€™ve used the TDD process to write the code in it.
* Reflection: I ended up going over a lot of the steps I did on tuesday as my pair was a little behind where I had got to with the pair the previous day. This actually helped as it reiterated over points that didn't really sink in the day before.

### Thursday 1st July
* Goal(s):
Gain a better understanding of TDD process and using rspec. Familiarise myself with OO principles.
* Plan:
Attend TDD workshop and continue practicing TDD and rspec during pair programming. During solo learning research 00 principles.
* Evidence:
I will ask my pair to give feedback on how effectively I'm using TDD. I will give a basic explantion on what 00 principles are.
* Reflection:
