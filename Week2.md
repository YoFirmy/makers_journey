# Week 2

## Weekly Goals
### Goals set by Makers
* Use all of week 1's skills (don't underestimate the importance of this)
* Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage
* Unit test classes in isolation using mocking
* Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)
* Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback

### Goals set by myself
* Become more confident at using doubles/mocking principles
* Gain a better understanding of Domain modelling

## Weekly Plan
* At the end of every day write out the goals for the next day.
* Attend every workshop and meditation session.
* Return to resources listed on [week outlines](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/main/week_outlines.md) when I am stuck for what to do.
* Complete as much of the Weekly Challenge as possible

## Daily Goals
