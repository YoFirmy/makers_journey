# Week 2

## Weekly Goals
### Goals set by Makers
* Use all of week 1's skills (don't underestimate the importance of this)
* Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage
* Unit test classes in isolation using mocking
* Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)
* Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback

### Goals set by myself
* Become more confident at using doubles/mocking principles
* Gain a better understanding of Domain modelling

## Weekly Plan
* At the end of every day write out the goals for the next day.
* Attend every workshop and meditation session.
* Return to resources listed on [week outlines](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/main/week_outlines.md) when I am stuck for what to do.
* Complete as much of the Weekly Challenge as possible

## Daily Goals
### Monday 5th July
* Goal(s):
Practice skills learnt last week with a focus on Domain modelling
* Plan:
Get a headstart on the weekly challenge and try to implement Domain modelling within it
* Evidence
I will write down the domain models I create [here](https://github.com/YoFirmy/makers_journey/blob/main/Week2Evidence.md) 
* Reflection:
I was able to practice TDD very well but I still don't feel very sure about domain modelling, I feel I simply need more practice.

### Tuesday 6th July
* Goal(s):
Continue practicing skills learnt last week with a focus on Domain modelling
* Plan:
Attend the domain modelling workshop and continue trying to implement Domain modelling within the Oystercard weekly challenge.
* Evidence
I will write down the domain models I create [here](https://wireframe.cc/KfI2Xp) and [here](https://wireframe.cc/9zLpqn)
* Reflection:
The domain modelling workshop helped alot, it introduced me to using class diagrams which I very a very useful resource, and makes logical sense. I have become a bit confused with the TDD process however from working through the Oystercard challenge. I feel that after creating a domain model from the user stories, the way I am trying to apply TDD means that I work in a different way to how the challenges layout the challenges based on the user stories. I have arranged to speak with my tutor tomorrow to figure out where I'm going wrong.

### Wednesday 7th July
* Goal(s):
Continue practicing skills learnt last week with a focus on TDD
* Plan:
I plan to meet with one of the course tutors to make sure my TDD process is correct. Also practice the TDD process on the weekly challenge.
* Evidence
I will ask my tutor and pair partners to give feedback on my TDD process. Which will be documented [Here](https://github.com/YoFirmy/makers_journey/blob/main/Week2Evidence.md)
* Reflection: I think I implemented TDD very well and I am starting to become much more confident in my process. From the feedback given to me from my pair I have realised that the only thing I need to work on in the TDD process is refactoring. I tend to do refactor after the fact and in solo time so that as a pair we can keep working forward with the challenges but I have realised this is a bad habit to get into.

### Thursday 8th July
* Goal(s):
Continue practicing skills learnt last week with a focus on incorporating refactoring in my TDD process.
* Plan:
Keep practicing the TDD process while working on the weekly challenge. Ask my pair to point out when I'm skipping the refactoring step.
* Evidence
I will ask my pair partners to give feedback on my TDD process and if I'm using refactoring or not. Which will be documented [Here](https://github.com/YoFirmy/makers_journey/blob/main/Week2Evidence.md)
* Reflection:
